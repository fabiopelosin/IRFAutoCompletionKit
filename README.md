_Warning this library is under development and is not completely functional._

Small kit designed to provide autocompletion triggered by a character. Built in
support is provided for emojis and completions from an user list. The base
classes are easily extendible to provide support for other uses.

Currently only OS X is supported, however many of the classes would compile (in
some cases with minor adaptations) on iOS.
